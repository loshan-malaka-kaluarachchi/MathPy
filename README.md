# Mathematic variables

Implementation of classes to model symbolic variables.
Properties of a algebraic variable.

For algebraic terms, $a$ is the coefficient, $x$ is the symbol for the variable and $p$ is the power.
$$ a \cdot x^{p} $$

### Case 1: Variables with equal powers can only be added
$$ a \cdot x^{p} + b \cdot x^{p} = \( a + b\) \cdot x^{p} $$ 

### Case 2: If coefficients and powers equal to one, they can be hidden
$$ 1 \cdot x^{1} = x $$
