# Mathematic variables

Implementation of classes to model symbolic variables.
Properties of a algebraic variable.

For algebraic terms, $a$ is the coefficient, $x$ is the symbol for the variable and $p$ is the power.

$$ a \cdot x^{p} $$

### Case 1: Variables with equal powers can be added

$$ a \cdot x^{p} + b \cdot x^{p} = \( a + b\) \cdot x^{p} $$
